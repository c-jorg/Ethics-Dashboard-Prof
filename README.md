# The Project

The project provides you an opportunity to build upon the foundational knowledge acquired in this course. It is designed to help you develop an advanced understanding of software engineering principles, tools, and techniques using structured requirements gathering and analysis, software development process, design patterns, software architecture, and software testing.  You will also need to consider your development methodology (don’t use waterfall), software metrics, and software quality assurance.

As a team, you will select a project, develop a set of requirements, conduct a formal analysis of the project, develop an architecture, and then using TDD and an Agile workflow, iterate and develop your projects.  During your project, you MUST consider design patterns and anti-patterns, TDD, dockerization, and CI/CD.  The goal is not necessarily to build a complex system, but to practice and become comfortable with the techniques, be able to analyze and decompose a problem, and incrementally develop and deploy a solution using a branching workflow.

Internally, within your team, you are free to manage efforts and tasks with the understanding that everyone is expected to contribute equally in some fashion.  During the project, you will have the chance to confidentially conduct peer reviews using the credit-earned model (see document on Canvas regarding this) at a number of key points.

You must have:

* Unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality
* A deployment pipeline using CI/CD to automatically test and deploy changes to the codebase
* Identified what design patterns you are using and describe why
* Dockerized deployment
* Continual and ongoing work using TDD 

## Project Goals:

* To deepen the students' understanding of software engineering principles, tools, and techniques.
* To enable students to apply software engineering principles, tools, and techniques to the development of complex software systems.
* To introduce students to agile development methodologies, software metrics, and software quality assurance.
* To foster collaboration and teamwork among students in the development of software systems.

## Project Objectives:

By the end of this project, students will be able to:

* Apply the software development process model, to the development of a software system
* Design software systems using appropriate design patterns and principles
* Develop software architectures for complex software systems
* Use software testing techniques to ensure the quality of software systems
* Apply agile development methodologies to the development of software systems
* Apply software metrics to evaluate the quality of software systems
* Develop software quality assurance plans to ensure the quality of software systems
* Apply and develop a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
* Utilize dockerization to containerize your application
* Work collaboratively in teams to develop software systems

## Evaluation:

**Milestone #1** – Team Formation and Planning Framework (Sep. 30th) – Set up and join your team.   Let me know who is on your team (2%)

**Milestone #2** – Project Description and Requirements (OCT. 23rd).  A summary of “What” your project is, who the users are, and “What” your project will do (functional, non-functional requirements, etc) including user stories and use cases (properly dressed with the appropriate level of abstraction.   Consider the tools (18%)

**Milestone #3** – Formal Analysis and Architecture (OCT. 28).  
 * Use the appropriate models to present the details about what your system will look like, what it will do/be composed of and what your architecture is. (10%)

**Milestone #4** – First Sprint (Testing/R&R Report/Release) (Nov. 11th) (20%)

**Milestone #5** – Second Sprint (Testing/R&R Report/Release) (Nov. 25th) (20%)

**Milestone #6** – Final Report/Demo video (Dec. 13th) (30%)
